When filing bankruptcy, Karat Financial should be included in the list of your creditors. Then, the bankruptcy court will send us the notice.\

If we weren't included on your list of creditors, you can send us your bankruptcy notice issued by your local court or Bankruptcy Administrator. Please send this via email and snail mail to ensure we receive written and immediate notice. Our email and physical address can be found below.\
