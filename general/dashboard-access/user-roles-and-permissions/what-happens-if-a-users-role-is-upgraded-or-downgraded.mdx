title: "What happens if a user’s role is upgraded or downgraded?"

**Upgrade:** The user may be prompted to agree to additional terms before getting access.

**Downgrade:** Access is reduced, but there’s no disruption to current experience.

**All changes** will trigger an email notification to the user and all Admins.
