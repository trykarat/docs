title: "Can roles be shared across products?"
---

Yes, except for an Admin role. A user can hold different roles for different products (e.g., Manager for Banking and Employee for Credit Card). An Admin will always have full account access across all products.

Check out what each role has access to for Banking here: [<u>What specific Banking access and permission does each role have?</u>](/karat-banking/user-roles-and-permissions/what-specific-banking-access-and-permission-does-each-role-have)

And for Card here: [<u>What specific Card access and permission does each role have?</u>](/karat-banking/user-roles-and-permissions/what-specific-card-access-and-permission-does-each-role-have)\
