3. Click **Sign in** and provide your Karat account login credentials or sign in with Google\*\*.\*\*

5. Select **which Karat accounts** you'd like to share with Quickbooks. Once done, click 'Connect selected accounts'.

   _Tip: We suggest you select "All current and future Karat accounts" to ensure that you share all account details with Quickbooks even if you later open new accounts with Karat._

6. Confirm that you see your account(s) and that they are all the correct type before selecting **Continue**. Then **select a date** or enter a **custom date** for how far back you want to pull transactions (you can pull up to the last 24 months of transactions). Select **Connect.**

   _Important: Both your Karat Banking "Checking" and "ATP Checking" accounts are "checking" account types. The Karat Credit Card is a "credit card" account type._

8. You should now be back in the **Bookkeeping \> Transactions \> Banking** screen where you should be able to see all of your Karat transactions ready to be categorized. Notice that this version of Quickbooks will “suggest” categories for you so that all you have to do is review and select **Confirm.**
