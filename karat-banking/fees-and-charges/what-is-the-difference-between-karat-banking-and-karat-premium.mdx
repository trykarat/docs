- The **Standard plan** is free and includes a business checking account, access to creator-focused Discord calls, savings on popular tools (such as Shopify, Kajabi, Notion, and more), up to 1.00% APY, and ACH & Wire transfers.
- The **Premium plan** gives you everything in Standard, plus VIP event access, up to 3.00% APY, and free domestic wires — all for only \$20/month or free with a \$35K balance.

Simple, powerful banking that grows with you.
