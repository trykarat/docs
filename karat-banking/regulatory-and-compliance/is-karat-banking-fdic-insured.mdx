title: "Is Karat Banking FDIC insured?"
---

Karat is not a bank, but we partner with Grasshopper Bank, N.A. member FDIC who offers FDIC insurance on all deposits. Through their partnership with IntraFi customers are able to leverage up to millions of dollars of FDIC insurance so you can rest easy that your money is safe.

Deposit placement through ICS is subject to the terms, conditions, and disclosures in the applicable agreements. Although deposits are placed in increments that do not exceed the FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount (“SMDIA”) at any one destination bank, a depositor’s balances at the institution that places deposits may exceed the SMDIA (e.g., before settlement for deposits or after settlement for withdrawals) or be uninsured (if the placing institution is not an insured bank). The depositor must make any necessary arrangements to protect such balances consistent with applicable law and must determine whether placement through ICS satisfies any restrictions on its deposits. A list identifying IntraFi network banks appears at [<u>https://www.intrafi.com/network-banks</u>](https://www.intrafi.com/network-banks). The depositor may exclude banks from eligibility to receive its funds. IntraFi and ICS are registered service marks, and IntraFi Cash Service is a service mark of IntraFi Network LLC.
