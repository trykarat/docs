We support four main user roles with varying access levels across Banking and Card.

- **Admin** – Full access to all products and settings.
- **Manager** – Broad access including transaction approval.
- **Employee** – Limited to their own activity, with transaction limits and approval workflows.
- **Accountant** – Read-only access to financial data for bookkeeping and reporting purposes.
