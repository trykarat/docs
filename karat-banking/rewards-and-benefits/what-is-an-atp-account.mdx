title: "What is an ATP account?"
---

An Automated Tax Planning (ATP) account is an additional account we offer alongside your checking account designed to help you prepare for tax season by automatically setting aside a portion of your income.

You can choose to have up to 50% of your income based deposits, such as YouTube Adsense payments or brand deals, automatically routed into your ATP account. Funds are pulled directly from deposits made to your checking account. While they’re easily transferrable back at any time, keeping them in the ATP account allows you to earn a higher APY on the funds.

Standard ATP accounts earn up to 0.75% APY, while users with Karat Premium enjoy up to 2.75% APY!
