title: "How do I issue a new Banking card for my employee?"
---

To issue a new card, log in to your Banking dashboard at [<u>app.trykarat.com/signin</u>](http://app.trykarat.com/signin). Then, navigate to the Banking \> Cards section. Select Issue New Card, and choose the employee you want to assign the card to. You can confirm a spending limit on that card.

If the employee is not already part of the organization, you can add them in Settings \> Manage team \> Invite team member.

<Note>
  Note: Banking card spending limits are tied to the employee and shared across all card(s) that are issued to them.
