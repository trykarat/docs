title: "Does Karat Banking offer virtual cards?"
---

Yes - all accounts offer virtual cards.​

We recommend adding your virtual card to your preferred mobile wallet and using it for any online recurring purchases. This not only allows you to seamlessly organize your expenses, it also makes your life easier if your physical card is lost or stolen.
