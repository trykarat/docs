Transfer time will vary by transfer method.

The fastest method is via Karat Transfer, which allows you to instantly transfer money between members of Karat Banking for free. Karat Banking also supports free ACH transfers, which take 3-5 business days to complete, as well as wires, which are processed in the same business day if initiated before 4:30 PM ET. Wires are free with Karat Premium Banking and cost only \$20 per transfer with Karat Banking.
