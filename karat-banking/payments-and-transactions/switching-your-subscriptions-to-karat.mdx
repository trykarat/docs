If you’ve recently opened a new Karat banking account or received a new debit card, you’ll want to update all your recurring payments to avoid missed charges or service interruptions. Follow the steps below to find and switch your subscriptions smoothly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Existing Subscriptions">
    Start by finding all services linked to your old account or card.

    **Check these sources:**

    - **Bank statements:** Review the last 3–6 months for recurring charges.
    - **Email inbox:** Search keywords like _receipt_, _subscription_, _invoice_, _renewal_, or _payment confirmation_.
    - **App store subscriptions:**
      - _iOS:_ Settings \> Your Name \> Subscriptions
      - _Android:_ Play Store \> Profile \> Payments & Subscriptions
    - **Payment platforms:** PayPal, Stripe, Venmo, Apple Pay, Google Pay, etc.
    - **Password managers:** Some track saved payment methods (e.g., 1Password, LastPass).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make a List of Your Recurring Payments">
    Organize your subscriptions with a simple table or spreadsheet, such as:

    | **Service Name**          | **Billing Amount**         | **Frequency**            | **Current Payment Method** | **Update URL**                                                |
    | :------------------------ | :------------------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Your Payment Details">
    Visit each service’s billing or account settings to update your payment method. You can find your Karat banking details in your dashboard at [<u>app.trykarat.com/signin</u>](http://app.trykarat.com/signin)!

    **Make sure to check the most common tools and platforms that you use, as well as payment processors like Stripe and PayPal.**

  <Step title="Monitor Your Old Account">
    Monitor your old account open for **30–60 days** to:

    - Catch any missed or delayed payments
    - Set up transaction alerts for notifications
    - Check for less frequent charges (annual or quarterly)
  </Step>
