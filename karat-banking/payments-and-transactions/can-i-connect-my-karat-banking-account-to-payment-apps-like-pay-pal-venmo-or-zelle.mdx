Yes! You can connect your Karat Banking account via Plaid to any app that supports Plaid, such as Venmo, PayPal, Rocket Money, and more. Just search for “Karat” and you’ll find us.

Additionally, you can also link your Karat Banking account to any mobile payment service that allows ACH connections. The ACH details for your account can be found on the banking homepage.
