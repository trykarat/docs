  <Step title="Log in & Open Creator Dashboard">
    - Sign into your Kick account and click your avatar → **Creator Dashboard** → go to **Revenue**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Your Stripe Setup">
    - If you're already set up, it may show “Connected with Stripe.”
    - Otherwise use the **Setup account** flow to reach your Stripe dashboard linked to Kick payouts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch to Your New Bank Details">
    **Option A: Via Kick’s Interface**

    - Select your country, then reach Step 7: **Select an account for payouts**.
    - Enter your **new bank routing number, account number, account type**, and confirm **currency** and **country**.
    - Click **Save**, review, then **Agree & Submit**. A confirmation email from Stripe will follow.

    **Option B: Directly in Stripe (if redirected)**

    - Log in to your **Stripe Dashboard**, go to Settings → **Bank accounts & scheduling** (or External Payout Accounts).
    - Click **Edit** next to the payout account. You may be prompted for verification via email/SMS or your previous bank details before proceeding.
    - Enter your new bank details and save. Stripe will confirm it via email and initiate the update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation & Testing">
    - Stripe will send a verification email—follow the link to confirm.
    - If any payout is already “in-transit,” it will go to the **old account**; future ones use the **new account**.
