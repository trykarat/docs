title: "How do I dispute a transaction?"
---

If you bought something that didn’t meet your expectations or paid for a service that wasn’t rendered, follow these steps to dispute the transaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact the merchant">
    Usually, merchants are happy to issue a refund when you didn’t get what you paid for. This is the quickest way to solve the problem—a merchant can typically refund your account or otherwise resolve the issue.

    Always reach out to the merchant directly, even if you’re not able to get through to them the first time. Email is the best way to do this since it creates a paper trail.

    If you don’t reach out to the merchant at all, you’ll likely lose the dispute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the refund policy">
    If the merchant didn’t refund you even though you followed their policy, screenshot the policy as evidence.

    If you realize the merchant was operating within their stated policy to not offer a refund, we suggest reaching out to them again instead of disputing. You’re more likely to be compensated in any way if you try to resolve the issue with them directly.

    If your refund was requested in a way that conflicts with the merchant’s policy, your case will be lost.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review any Terms of Service or Terms and Conditions">
    When you pay for a subscription or a service, there’s usually a legal sheet that states the terms for cancellation. Read through this before starting the dispute process. If you violated the terms stated, then your dispute will likely lose.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect your evidence">
    Any evidence you can send us will help us support your dispute when we take it to Visa. Picture evidence + a detailed description of the events create a strong case.

    Evidence we can use:

    - Call logs between you and the merchant, even if they didn’t answer
    - Emails between you and the merchant or attempts to start a conversation with them that didn’t receive a response
    - Any documents received when the purchase was made, receipts, the refund policy, etc.
    - Terms and Conditions or a Terms of Service sheet
    - All contracts between you and the merchant
  </Step>
</Steps>
