title: "I'm waiting for a hotel to release the hold on my card—how long does this take?"
---

Hotel holds can typically take 7-21 business days.

If a pending hold from a hotel has remained on your account longer, we recommend you reach out to the hotel to confirm that the hold has been released. If they confirm that the hold has been released longer than 21 business days, call, text, or email our concierge team.
