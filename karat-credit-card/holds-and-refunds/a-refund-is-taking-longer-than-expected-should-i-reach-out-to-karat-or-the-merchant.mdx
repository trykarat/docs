title: "A refund is taking longer than expected—should I reach out to Karat or the merchant?"
---

Refunds usually take 3-5 business days to process. If a refund is taking longer than that, reach out to the merchant to confirm that the refund has been processed on their end. If they confirm that it’s been processed and it has been longer than 5 business days, call, text, or email our concierge team.
