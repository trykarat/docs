title: "How daily repayments work with Flex Rewards"
---

With Flex Rewards, your Karat Card balance is automatically paid down every day through daily repayments from your linked autopay account.

## How it works

Daily repayments are processed automatically:

1. **Daily balance calculation**: At the end of each day (1:00 AM UTC), your Karat Card balance is calculated
2. **Automatic withdrawal**: If you have a balance, the amount is automatically withdrawn from your linked autopay bank account
3. **Balance reduction**: Your Karat Card balance is reduced, freeing up your available credit
4. **Tracking**: You can view all daily repayments in your Karat dashboard

## Benefits of daily repayments

Daily automatic repayments provide several advantages:

- **No manual payments needed**: Your balance is paid automatically—no need to schedule or remember payments
- **Better credit utilization**: Daily repayments keep your balance low, which can help your credit utilization ratio
- **More available credit**: As your balance is paid down daily, you have more credit available for new purchases
- **Simplified cash flow**: Smaller daily payments instead of one large monthly payment

## What you need to know

### Sufficient funds required

Make sure your autopay account has sufficient funds to cover your daily Karat Card balance. If a payment fails due to insufficient funds, you may need to make a manual payment.

### Changing your autopay account

You can change your autopay account at any time in your account settings. Daily repayments will continue using your newly selected account.

### Viewing your repayment history

All daily repayments are tracked in your Karat dashboard. You can view:
- The date of each repayment
- The amount withdrawn
- Your end-of-day balance
- The payment status

### No monthly billing cycle

With Flex Rewards and daily repayments, you don't have a traditional monthly billing cycle. Instead, your balance is settled daily, so you don't receive monthly statements in the same way.

## Troubleshooting

### What if a daily repayment fails?

If a daily repayment fails (for example, due to insufficient funds in your autopay account):
- You'll be notified of the failed payment
- You may need to make a manual payment to bring your account current
- Contact our concierge team for assistance

### Can I pause daily repayments?

Daily repayments are a required part of the Flex Rewards program. If you want to switch back to monthly billing, you'll need to opt out of Flex Rewards and return to the standard rewards program.
