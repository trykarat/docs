title: "Why was a purchase that fell within one of my categories not rewarded?"
---

Categories are set by the merchant, not the item itself. Because of this, we sometimes see odd categorizations, like a computer purchased through Amazon showing as a book store transaction.

Unfortunately our rewards system is based on the merchant classification, rather than the individual item(s) you purchased. If you’re anticipating a large purchase at a specific retailer, contact our concierge team by text or email and we’ll work with you to make sure your rewards are set up correctly.
