## Autopay requirement

Flex Rewards requires autopay to be enabled because the program includes daily automatic repayments. This means:
- You must link a bank account through Plaid
- Your account must have sufficient funds to cover daily balances
- Daily repayments will be automatically withdrawn from your linked account

## Account standing requirements

To maintain eligibility for Flex Rewards, your account must remain in good standing:
- No missed or failed payments
- Compliance with Karat Card terms and conditions
- Sufficient funds in your autopay account for daily repayments

## Switching between programs

### From standard rewards to Flex Rewards

If you're eligible and invited, you can opt in to Flex Rewards at any time through your dashboard. Once activated:
- Your standard rewards categories will no longer apply
- You'll immediately start earning 3x on all eligible purchases
- Daily repayments will begin

### From Flex Rewards to standard rewards

If you want to switch back to the standard rewards program, contact our concierge team. Keep in mind:
- You'll need to select three reward categories again
- You'll return to monthly billing instead of daily repayments
- You may not be able to re-enroll in Flex Rewards immediately
