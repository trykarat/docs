## Standard rewards program

With Karat's standard rewards program, you can select three rewards categories—find them on our [rewards page](http://trykarat.com/rewards). Most categories earn 3x points, but some earn 1-1.5x.

For more details about each category, call, text, or email our concierge team.

## Flex Rewards option

Karat also offers **Flex Rewards**, a premium program where you earn 3x rewards on **all** your spending—no category selection needed. Flex Rewards requires autopay with daily automatic repayments.
