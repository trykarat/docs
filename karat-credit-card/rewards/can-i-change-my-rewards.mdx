title: "Can I change my rewards?"

## Changing standard rewards categories

Absolutely. If you're on the standard rewards program, you can change your three reward categories at any time. Call, text, or email our concierge team and we'll make the change for you.

## Switching to Flex Rewards

If you're eligible for Flex Rewards, you can opt in to earn 3x on all spending instead of selecting categories. [Learn more about Flex Rewards](/karat-credit-card/rewards/what-is-flex-rewards).
