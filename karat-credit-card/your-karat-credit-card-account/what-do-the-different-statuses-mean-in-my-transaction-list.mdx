title: "What do the different statuses mean in my transaction list?"
---

Under the **Status** column in your transaction list, you’ll find your purchases or payments categorized by Capture, Pending, Reversed, Declined, Refunded, and Processed. Here’s a breakdown of each:

- **Capture:** \
  The transaction has been approved and cleared.​
- **Pending:** The transaction has been approved and is currently processing. This should clear in 2-3 business days. \
  If the status of a payment on your Karat account shows as pending, it means the payment is processing and should clear in the next 3-5 business days.


- **Reversed:** The transaction was once approved by the merchant but was then reversed. This happens on the merchant’s end—we recommend reaching out to them directly to resolve any issues with reversals. \
  If the merchant can’t help, text, call, or email our concierge team.\

- **Declined:** The purchase was declined due to the amount being higher than the spending room left on the card, potential fraud, or incorrect verification details.​\
  Our system will automatically send you an email when a payment has been declined with details explaining why. ​
- **Refunded:** A purchase was refunded by the merchant and has hit your Karat account. \
  If this is the status of a payment, it means at the time the payment finished processing there were insufficient funds for it to clear and the funds were returned to your bank account.


- **Processed:** This status will only apply to payments on your Karat account and means the payment has finished processing.
