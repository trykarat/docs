title: "How do I reschedule a payment?"
---

If you need to reschedule a payment, call, text, or email us as soon as possible. We’ll have our repayments team set up the new payment date or a payment plan if need be. Autopay runs on the first of each month—we need to know at least one day before to make sure we pause payment successfully.
