If you run into an issue linking a bank account that should be supported by Plaid, text us at 323-747-7086 or send an email to [<u>concierge@trykarat.com</u>](mailto:concierge@trykarat.com). We’ll look into the issue and let you know if there’s a better time to try and connect your account or if you should opt into an ACH link.
