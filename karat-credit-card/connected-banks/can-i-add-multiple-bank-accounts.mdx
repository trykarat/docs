Yes, connecting your bank accounts and credit cards is easy. Follow the steps below:

2. Scroll to the section titled "**Accounts and cards**". At the bottom of the table, you will see a blue link to "Add another bank"
3. Use the link and follow Plaid's instructions to complete linking your accounts
4. Once linked, you'll be prompted to note down how you use each account (whether it is for business only, personal only or a mix of both)
