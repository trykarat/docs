Karat offers two rewards programs:

## Standard rewards program

Cardholders get reward points in three categories of their choice. For every dollar you spend in your chosen categories, you'll earn 1-3x points.

You can choose from categories like travel, dining, camera equipment, clothing, cosmetics, ad spend, and more.

## Flex Rewards

With Flex Rewards, you earn 3x rewards on **all** eligible spending—no category selection needed. This program requires autopay with daily automatic repayments.
