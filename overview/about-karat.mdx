## **How does Karat make money?**

We make money from interchange fees, which are paid to us by merchants whenever you use your card.

## **How old/stable is Karat?**

Karat was established in 2019 and is a Y-Combinator company backed by SignalFire, Union Square Ventures, and CRV.

Individual investors include Twitch cofounder Kevin Lin, YouTube cofounder Steve Chen, Twitter cofounder Biz Stone, and the former CEOs of CAA, Wealthfront, and TikTok.

Creator-led investors include 3LAU, Graham Stephan, Sam Kolder, Carter Sharer, Nas Daily, Lenny Rachitsky, Josh Richards, TierZoo, and Alexandra Botez.

In 2022, Karat was named one of Fast Company’s 10 Most Innovative Financial Companies, and Y-Combinator included us as one of its Top Companies.

## **Who runs Karat?**

Karat was cofounded by Will Kim (finance at Goldman Sachs and Kiva) and Eric Wei (product management at Instagram), friends who bonded over their interest in creators and the media landscape.

They incubated Karat at Y-Combinator, obsessed over feedback day and night, and began scaling the team. Today our ranks include talent from YouTube, Shopify, Meta, Netflix, and Lionsgate.

## **Getting a job at Karat**

Banks don’t understand creators today. Our customers create content for millions as a full-time career but receive poor service and terrible rates from banks, wasting them both time and money. We’re building financial services for digital content creators, providing tools to help them scale as their followings grow. We want hungry and ambitious folks to help us!
